# Project Express API

This project's goal is to create a RESTful API using Node in Express. The API should have endpoints which return an array of data or a single object. With the provided hardcoded dataset in JSON format with a list of over 1000 Netflix shows and show details I managed to create my first API by manipulating the data with JavaScript methods like: filter(), find() and slice().

## The problem

I first outlined the key requirements and functionality expected from the Netflix API. I identified the need for endpoints that support listing all available shows, retrieving individual shows, and handling different browsing options. Additionally, I considered potential future features, leading to the inclusion of placeholder endpoints for more complex operations.

I solved it with help from my Orange teammates in the technigo bootcamp. And a bit of chatGPT for a better understanding of the code.

If I had more time on my side, I would had considered to make a detailed documentation to include descriptions for each route, expected parameters, and example responses for improved usability.
